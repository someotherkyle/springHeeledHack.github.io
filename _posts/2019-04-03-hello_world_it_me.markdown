Before we get started, I would like to disclose that this portion of the Flatiron School Curriculum intimidates me more than any coding requirement and that I have no idea what this blog will entail. Having said that, thank you for your patience and understanding in this difficult time. 3 thoughts and prayers to each of you.



My interest in programming has been around since I first tinkered with RPG maker in the mid to late 90's. I was alwasy curious as to how things worked behind the scenes (mostly so I could exploit them) and computing was no different. Unfortunately, my distaste for academia pushed me in another direction professionally but my interest in programming remained. I found myself studying a number of "teach yourself to code" resources available online and would try to implement things I had learned into my day to day life. I would write silly programs that would take in a list of options for dinner and tell me what I should eat to overcome my indecision. While I was the Operations Manager for a pressure washing company, I was writing scripts attached to Google Docs and Forms that would update management through a Discord server as to the progress of crews from the night prior. Inevitably, my interest would plateau or I would get distracted with something else and my understanding would degrade and I would start over a few months down the road. Somewhere between my 5th reading of Zed Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way" and clipping myself to the ball of a crane for a ride to the top of a dead tree, I decided I wanted to pursue programming for real and commit to making a career change. 



I have quit my job and enrolled into a Full Time Software Engineering program with Flatiron School and am excited to see what the future holds. Buckle up things might get weird.
