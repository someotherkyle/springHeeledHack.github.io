Project # 1 -  Complete

It's nice to be able to say that and getting here wasn't without its hurdles. Two things really stuck out to me about this project. First, there were no tests to point you in the right direction. If you wanted to wander off and metaphorically chase wild geese, nobody (and no test) was going to stop you. Second, and likely a direct result of number one, was the importance of keeping things simple. 

Unlike the labs we've been exposed to so far, this project didn't come with tests. At a glance, this doesn't seem to be a huge change from the labs we've grown accustomed to but shortly after I started writing my code, I missed these tests. Tests do more than just tell us our code is working, they also provide a goal for us to focus on. They give our code direction. A NoMethodError tells me that I need a method and I can usually tell pretty quickly from its name what it is expected to do. Even if I'm wrong, the next failure will let me know and I can continue along my journey to lab completion. After a brief moment of silence for the tests I took for granted, I had to get this project done.

Eventually, I realized that this project was really no different than the labs that we've done before. All we are really doing is getting data from the internet as opposed to a nested hash or whatever data structure we've worked on before. Using 'open-uri' and 'nokogiri' and a little bit of code, we can turn that information into something very familiar. I didn't need to complicate things and I didn't need tests (though they would be helpful). I just needed to see the problem for what it was and solve it. 

I took away from this project a realization that before you can solve a problem, you need to understand it and see it for what it is. Also, that I need to learn to write tests.
